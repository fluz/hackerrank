# Day 1: Basic Statistics - A Warmup

## Objective

In this challenge, we practice calculating the mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and confidence intervals in statistics.

## Task

Given a single line of `N` space-separated integers describing an array, calculate and print the following:

1. *Mean(m)*: The average of all intergers.
2. *Array Median*: If the number of integers is odd, display the middle element. Otherwise, display the average of the two middle elements.
3. *Mode*: The element(s) that occur most frequently. If multiple elements satisfy this criteria, display the numerically smallest one.
4. Standard Deviation (σ):

Other than the modal values (which should all be integers), the answers should be in decimal form, correct to a single decimal point, 0.0 format. An error margin of ±0.1 will be tolerated for the standard deviation. The mean, mode and median values should match the expected answers exactly.

Assume the numbers were sampled from a normal distribution. The sample is a reasonable representation of the distribution. A user can approximate that the population standard deviation ≃ standard deviation computed for the given points with the understanding that assumptions of normality are convenient approximations.

## Scoring

Scoring is proportional to the number of test cases cleared.

## Input Format

The first line contains an integer, `N`, denoting the number of elements in the array. 
The second line contains `N` space-separated numbers describing the elements of the array.

## Constraints

* 10 <= `N` <= 2500
* 0 <= xi <= 10^5

## Output Format

A total of four lines are required (in the following order:

1. Mean (format: 0.0) on the first line.
2. Median (format: 0.0) on the second line.
3. Mode(s) (numerically smallest integer in the case of multiple integers)
4. Standard Deviation (format: 0.0)
